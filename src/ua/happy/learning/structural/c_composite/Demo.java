/**
 * Composite is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with
 * these structures as if they were individual objects. *
 *
 * Composite examples from standard Java library:
 * - java.awt.Container#add(Component) (practically all over Swing components)
 * - javax.faces.component.UIComponent#getChildren() (practically all over JSF UI components)
