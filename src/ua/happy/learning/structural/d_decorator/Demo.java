/**
 * Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects
 * inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.
 *
 * Here are some examples of Decorator in core Java libraries: *
 *     All subclasses of java.io.InputStream, OutputStream, Reader and Writer have constructors that accept objects of their own type. *
 *     java.util.Collections, methods checkedXXX(), synchronizedXXX() and unmodifiableXXX(). *
 *     javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequestWrapper and HttpServletResponseWrapper *
 * Identification: Decorator can be recognized by creation methods or constructor that accept objects of the same class or interface as a current class.
