/**
 * Flyweight is a structural design pattern that lets you fit more objects into the available amount of RAM by sharing
 * common parts of state between multiple objects instead of keeping all of the data in each object.
 *
 * Examples of Flyweight in core Java libraries:
 *     java.lang.Integer#valueOf(int) (also Boolean, Byte, Character, Short, Long and BigDecimal)
 * Identification: Flyweight can be recognized by a creation method that returns cached objects instead of creating new.
